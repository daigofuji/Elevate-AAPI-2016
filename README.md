Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) make up the fastest growing racial group, and are projected to surpass 50 million in number by 2060. AAPIs are also one of the most diverse racial groups, representing dozens of ethnicities, cultures, and migration stories from around the world. In the past decade, there have been significant improvements in the availability of data about AAPIs, on issues ranging from socioeconomic status to education, health, and civic participation. Many of these datasets include information on the detailed origin of AAPIs, but are underutilized.  We hope to change this starting with Elevate: AAPI Data Challenge.

About the Challenge

The White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI), which is housed within the Department of Education, and University of California, Riverside (AAPIData.com) are sponsoring this challenge to hear from the public about novel approaches to analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data about AAPIs, particularly data that are broken out by detailed origin (such as Cambodian, Korean, Native Hawaiian, etc.).  Submissions may include, for example: policy papers that rely on identified AAPI data sets or subsets, compelling infographics, web applications, data tables, blog posts, animations, videos, and other creative mediums. What can you tell or show us about the AAPI community through data?

Selected applicants will be invited to a convening in Washington, DC hosted by WHIAAPI and AAPIData.com on October 7, 2016, to discuss their work.

The data source for the submission is open to applicants.  Here are few examples for your consideration:

Judging Criteria

The review panel will consider criteria such as the following:

* Topical Relevance: Does the application address Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, either as racial groups, or with reference to any particular detailed origin group (such as Cambodian, Filipino, Samoan, etc.)?
* Soundness of Methodology: For example, if the product manipulates a dataset to make the data more useful, we are interested in learning about what datasets would be used, and how the application would work so it can be replicated.
* Relevance to Policy Audiences: For example, does the application identify an issue that should be of concern to government agencies or other policy actors at the federal, state, or local level?
Accessibility to General Audiences: For example, is the application accessible to audiences that may not be well versed in statistical methods or analyses?
* Novelty: For example, does the application showcase data in a way that is unique?
Prizes

The Elevate: AAPI Data Challenge is non-monetary.
Selected applicants will be invited to a convening hosted by WHIAAPI and AAPIData.com in Washington, DC, on October 7, 2016.
